# Combine.finance is a fork of sushiswap with some customizations

https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap

## Customizations Required:

1. Remove devaddr comissions
2. Remove x10 bonus logic
2. Rename SUSHI token to COMB (combine.finance)
3. Implement deflation logic, rewards start with ~0.007 COMB per-block (~40 COMB/day) and will go down 0.1% on every block
4. Limit maximum supply of tokens to 10000 COMB

## Launch plan

Please make sure current contracts will work as expected during all these steps:

1. Deploy CombToken contract
2. Mint 2500 tokens for the owner
3. Deploy MasterChef contract
4. Transfer CombToken's ownership to MasterChef
5. Add 5 LP tokens to the pools list:
5.1 COMB-ETH with _allocPoint = 7000
5.2 4 other pairs with _allocPoint = 750
5.3 This will cause 70% of the reward pool to be allocated to COMB-ETH stakers and the rest will get 7.5
